# Syntexhub_Project_3_Seaborn_Correlation_Analysis
Project 3 – Correlation Heatmap &amp; Pairwise Relationships using Seaborn on the Diamonds dataset. Part of Syntexhub Data Science Internship (Week 2).

📊 Syntexhub Project 3 – Seaborn Correlation & Visualization Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project is part of the Syntexhub Data Science Internship (Week 2 – Project 3).
The objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis using Seaborn, a Python data visualization library built on Matplotlib.

The project focuses on:

Correlation heatmaps

Pairwise relationships

Numerical and categorical data visualization

Distribution analysis

Linear regression analysis

Aesthetic customization of plots

The Diamonds dataset is used to demonstrate Seaborn’s full visualization capabilities.

🔍 Key Insights

Carat weight has the strongest positive correlation with diamond price.

Physical dimensions (x, y, z) are highly correlated with carat.

Diamond price distribution is right-skewed, indicating fewer high-priced diamonds.

Cut quality significantly influences price trends and regression behavior.

🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete and structured approach to data visualization and correlation analysis using Seaborn.
By combining statistical analysis with visually appealing plots, the project highlights how raw data can be transformed into meaningful insights.

The project fulfills all requirements of Syntexhub Project 3 and showcases strong foundational skills in exploratory data analysis and Python-based visualization.
